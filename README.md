A (very) simple application I built for the clips I record with my friends. I built it because the files always exceed the 25 file size that most platforms have, so I can't really send the clips to the group chat. And I don't trust online compressor options.

### How it works
It's actually just a very simple wrapper for ffmpeg. It is currently not customizable. It uses the H.265 / HEVC codec for compression.

Here's a before / after compression of a video file.
