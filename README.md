<br />A simple application that can take a video file (currently only supports .mp4) and compress it, so that the file size gets much, much smaller. I built it because I often save funny highlights with my friends, but these files get bigger than the max file size on Discord/Facebook etc. So, I use this to quickly compress the file and save it to a specified location on my computer.

It's basically just a very simple wrapper for ffmpeg, which runs one command that uses H.265 / HEVC compression to achieve a smaller file size. :)
